# Quarter-RSS

Quarter Sized RSS (2.5x Kerbin scale, 1/4 Real Solar System Scale)

Pap1723

Github: https://github.com/pap1723/QuarterRSS

This mod will convert the Kerbol System into our Real Solar System, but at 25% of the actual size. This makes it 2.5 times larger than KSP stock sizes.

## INSTALLATION:
Extract to KSP/GameData. You should have one dll (Module Manager) in the root of GameData, and three new folders: QuarterRSS, Kopernicus, and ModuleFlightIntegrator. However, you are NOT DONE YET.

## TEXTURE INSTALLATION
Now, you must select a texture resolution. Download a pre-made pack (8192, 4096, or 2048) and then, if desired, selectively replace with different-resolution texutres. Note that 8192 is dangerous: you will almost assuredly run out of memory on 32-bit versions of the game.

You can get the textures from: https://github.com/Pap1723/ScaledRSS-Textures

Go to the releases page and grab one of the resolution packs.

The path of the folder will be KSP/GameData/RSS-Textures

Make sure you download from here and not the other RSS versions. There are additional biomes as well as additional planets that are included with the QuarterRSS version.

## RECOMMENDED MODS:
It has been figured out by many people the 2.5x scale is the proper scale for KSP. With the way the engines and masses are configured, "realistically" sized rockets would exist in a 2.5x stock scale. Thus I present you with Quarter Size RSS.

These mods are highly recommended as their sizes work perfectly with a 2.5x scale of stock. You should not need to make any adjustments to the values of any of the parts to be able to get them to function exactly how you want them to.
